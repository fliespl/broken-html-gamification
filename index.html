        <h1>About Gamification</h1>
        <p>Gamification is the application of game-design elements and game principles
            in non-game contexts. It involves using game mechanics, such as points, badges, and leaderboards, to engage
            users and motivate them to achieve specific goals. Gamification has gained popularity in various fields,
            including education, marketing, and employee training.
        <a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grywalizacja" target="_blank">Gamification</a> taps into the natural human desire for competition, achievement,
            and rewards. By incorporating game elements into tasks or processes, it can enhance user engagement, promote
            learning, and drive desired behaviors.</p>
